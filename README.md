# Gun Violence In America
Second Project about Gun Violence in America


Using [gun violence data](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) from kaggle, I found how many injuries and deaths were caused by guns in the USA.
Then using [population estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html) from the census.gov, I found normalized it for the number of residents in each state.
I then displayed the [data on charts and maps](https://gvinusa.herokuapp.com/) and hosted it on Heroku.
